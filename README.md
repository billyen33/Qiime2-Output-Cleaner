## Qiime2-Output-Cleaner
This program takes the feature-table and taxonomy TSV/CSV output from Qiime2, selects the top n most abundant taxa per sample, and plots a community composition graph displaying those taxa in each sample. Unlike the built-in Qiime2 taxonomy bar plot visualization, this allows the user to easily limit the community composition plot to the most abundant taxa, which is important for visualizing samples with thousands of taxa present. This program was built on Python 3.8.5 with Matplotlib 3.2.2, pandas 1.0.5, and NumPy 1.19.0, so adjustments might be needed for past or future versions of Python and its associated libraries.

# How To Use Qiime2-Output-Cleaner:
1. First, process your raw FASTA files with Qiime2 and output the feature-table and taxonomy TSV or CSV files.
2. Run Qiime2-output-cleaner.py and follow the prompts in the labels and entry boxes to tell it where your input TSV/CSV files are, indicate where you want your output table saved to, customize the number of taxa you choose, and change the graph parameters. Note that the paths of the input and output files must include the actual name of the file itself, since those are not implied (e.g. C:\Research/ won't work for an output path, you have to state C:\Research/output.csv to make a CSV called output.csv there). The output file must end with ".csv".
3. After making sure that all your entries are right, press "Generate Output CSV & Plot Graph" to create your output CSV and graph. The time it takes to run will depend on the size of your dataset and the number of top taxa you selected for. If your entries are invalid, an error message will show up in the terminal you used to run Qiime2-output-cleaner.py.
4. A popup window displaying the desired graph should appear within a few seconds, and the output file will be saved to your specified path at the same time. You can then use the Matplotlib toolbar on the bottom of the graph window to zoom in on parts of the graph or manipulate its width and height. When you are satisfied with the graph format, press the "Save" button on the toolbar to save your graph as a PNG. The program can be used continuously, so you can experiment with the legend font size and title text in the main window or enter in new datasets without having to rerun the Python file.
5. Congratulations! You now have a sorted CSV file displaying the top n taxa in your samples and a community composition graph PNG file to visualize it.
